Advent of Code 2018
===================

This is the C++17 code I wrote for [Advent of Code 2018][AoC2018].

Doing AoC for the first time in 2019, I had so much fun I decided to go back
and try some of the earlier years.

Disclaimer: These were written to solve the problem of the day, so do not
expect beautiful code.
